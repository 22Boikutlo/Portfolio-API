# DemoApi

I created an API with using SwaggerAPI that connects to the database hosted on my Azure account. This API collects my personal information from my database and populate fields on my portfolio website. Data can also be added from my frontend and saved in the respective table in my database. I am working on ensuring that there is a signin that allows only users the right credentials to be able to add skills or projects to the portfolio.
The website is written in react, css and html.
